Employed the minimum spanning tree algorithm for super pixel segmentation, leading to an approximately 20% improvement in image preprocessing segmentation efficiency.

Independently delved into the Opencv framework and graphical programming, employing C++, Opencv, and MFC to conceive and finalize an interactive system for superpixel image segmentation
