The main motivation would be to provide a comparative analysis of visualization techniques for both malware detection and malware classification tasks. The approaches in the literature usually use different datasets and thus, the approaches are not comparable. It would be interesting to also compare the preprocessing time, i.e. transformation from PE file to visualization. In addition, while visualization techniques work fairly well for malware classification, it is not the case for malware detection. Thus, it would be also interesting to describe the challenges and limitations of these visualization techniques.



Based on Pytorch, utilized grayscale images along with techniques such as structural entropy analysis for
effective malware detection and classification.

Conducted tests on the BODMAS dataset and various malicious file datasets, recorded and compared runtime
results using W&B, while monitoring the carbon emission trajectory of the model. 

Currently in the process of writing a Systemization of Knowledge (SoK) paper.

This project is led by [Daniel Gibert]([CONTRIBUTING.md](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=lAAwRpMAAAAJ)https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=lAAwRpMAAAAJ). 

It will be tested on [CeADAR](https://ceadar.ie/)'s server and a SoK(https://www.jsys.org/type_SoK/) paper is being written. The complete code is still waiting to be integrated, so I will only release the part I did.
